**Task Title:TO-DO-List
**Task description:The HTML document provided is the foundational structure for a Todo List web application. It begins with standard HTML declarations, specifying the document type, language, and character encoding. The document's head section includes essential meta tags, viewport settings, and links to external resources such as stylesheets for styling (main.css) and fonts (Fira Sans and Montserrat). The body of the document is encapsulated within a main element, housing various sections that collectively form the user interface.
The "Greeting" section welcomes users with a dynamic input field for entering their name. Moving on, the "New Todo" section allows users to create todos through a form featuring input fields for todo content, radio buttons for category selection (business or personal), and a submit button.
The "Todo List" section is dedicated to displaying the list of todos. It includes a heading and a container (div with id "todo-list") where todos will be dynamically added and showcased. The document also imports an external JavaScript file (main.js), indicating the presence of client-side scripting for enhanced functionality.
Throughout the document, various classes and IDs are strategically assigned to elements, facilitating styling and interaction. For instance, classes like "bubble," "business," and "personal" suggest potential visual styling elements, and IDs like "name" and "new-todo-form" provide hooks for JavaScript functionality.
The integration of Google Fonts (Fira Sans and Montserrat) contributes to the overall aesthetic appeal of the web page. In summary, this HTML document lays the groundwork for a Todo List application, with a focus on user interaction, dynamic content creation, and a visually pleasing interface. The specific styling and dynamic behavior are likely defined in the associated CSS and JavaScript files, respectively.
Challange Faced:Developing a Todo List web application, as presented in the provided HTML code, involves addressing several challenges to ensure a robust and user-friendly experience. The first challenge lies in achieving an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design, ensuring the application adapts well to various devices and screen sizes. This encompasses writing effective CSS code, utilizing fonts, and implementing responsive design principles.
The core functionality of the application relies on JavaScript to handle user interactions such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks. Implementing this logic seamlessly is another challenge, demanding careful consideration of the DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content updates.
Data persistence is a crucial aspect, and addressing this challenge involves deciding whether to incorporate a backend system or local storage mechanism. This ensures that users retain their todo tasks even after page reloads.
Accessibility is a key consideration to make the application usable for individuals with disabilities.
**Solution Implemented:JavaScript Functionality: The core functionality, such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, is implemented using JavaScript. Event listeners and DOM manipulation are employed to handle user interactions, providing a dynamic and interactive interface
**Learnings:Not Required.
**Project Update:Completed.
